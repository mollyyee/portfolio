                            <h4> Round 1 of Research </h4>
                            <p> In a 7-week research sprint, with a discussion forum of 130+ users, I honed in on specific pain points & created alternate prototypes for those pain points, which I iterated over with user feedback for 4 weeks. The result was 3 separate prototypes that represent 3 levels of receptiveness towards automation.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p> Crawl: Still a reactive process, where users wrote some custom scripts in their cLI for specific operation actions, like deleting orphaned VMDKs. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p> Walk: The state describing users who proactively take optimization actions in an organized and designated period of time (mostly on a quarterly basis), to reclaim unused resources and better size their virtual machines.  </p>
                            <br>
                            <p> Run: A hypothetical and ideal state where users have set up the system to optimize their environment on their behalf. The userâ€™s involvement is mostly passive, reviewing reports of actions taken or scheduled.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h4> Round 2 of Research </h4>
                            <p>I took these 3 prototypes to our user conference to test with focus groups of 36 users to find that many users were already building variations of these tools in scripts. </p>

                                <p> Many users were automating their environments by writing scripts in a command line interface, whereas my solution only considered the GUI experience. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p> The bounds of the solution was still reactive. We discovered that virtual infrastructure team's end users often used resources in a way that could cause performance issues. So we designed a tool to help virtual infrastructure admins mitigate the expected issues from the end users. 
                                    However, since VMware also makes tools for end users in the product suite, the workflow could proactively begin in those tools to help users adhere to best practices, so when the time comes for virtual infrastructure teams to optimize the environment, proper infrastructure has already been put in place to make it extra easy. 
                              </p> 
                                <br>
                                <p> In automated optimization, the market is moving on without us. Sophisticated IT organizations were already spending resources building out internal tools to achieve this functionality. However, because these scripts and systems require a lot of upkeep and management, users would still rather use a vendor managed system.   </p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                <p id = "caseHeader"> Reflections on building cohesive, cross-product experiences</p>
                                <p> After presenting the findings and prototypes with my product manager, upper management got really excited about executing this experience. However, I designed the features largely independent of the constraints of the current rule engine. In addition, I didn't consider integrations with existing products in the product suite, so I proposed features that overlap with other products' future roadmap. In the future, I would better consider the ecosystem that features need to live within and seek early feedback from stakeholders in other products to better understand the cross-product flow.
