                    A part of a 100 days of creativity challenge, this illustration is my favorites. <br> <br>
                    I've learned that creativity is the result of two things. One, the skills and experiences of the maker, which frame how inspiration is seen and what can be created. Two, the intersection of circumstances, thoughts, and inspiration.

            <h2> <br> Friendship is a deliberate accident. </h2>
            <p> 
                    <br> <br> Moments are like those big intersections in New York City. They're where people, places and a point in time collide. These intersections are usually a turbulent sea of other voices, other people, and other hands. <br> <br>
                    Without realizing it, people can be good at weaving through the crowd. Amidst the others, they choose each other. In this way, friendship is born out of accident and sustained by choice.
