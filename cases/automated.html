            <h2> PROJECT CONTEXT</h2>
            <h3> Datacenter operations were becoming more automated, but our tool was not.  </h3>
            <p> 
            My design manager asked me to create a vision to automate datacenter optimization. This would allow our users to proactively prevent issues in their infrastructure performance. <br> <br>
            Countless prototypes, many research sessions, and three releases later, I led the delivery of the automated optimization vision for a 1 billion dollar infrastructure management product.<br> <br>
            This means that users who used to spend at least 3 days learning how to automate operations with scripts, then plenty more hours managing these scripts, could do it all in less than 5 minutes, with precision and control. They were ecstatic.            </p>

                <h2> MY CONTRIBUTION</h2>
                <p> 
                I conducted an 8-week research session with 200 users to fully understand users' optimization problems. As a result, I created three end-to-end prototypes with focused use cases representing various degrees of automation, and validated how much automation users were ready for through focus groups with 36 users. After validating direction, I prototyped countless iterations, collaborating with my PM and engineers, to create the hand-off assets that got shipped.

            <h2> THE PROBLEM</h2>
            <h3> There was no way to automate highly manual optimization tasks. </h4>
            <p> 
            Current automation required sometimes non-technical users to learn scripts. Due to the usability of our script's documentation at the time, it could take 3 days to learn how to use these scripts. The method was error prone, and it required a lot of maintanence. <br>
            <br>
            In the research forum of 200 users over 8 weeks, I found pain points, created natural workflows, and mapped the current customer journey. 
            <ul>
            <li> Our users didn't own the infrastructure they wanted to take action on. They needed approval from their stakeholders, and even more permission to automate actions. </li>
            <li> Different companies had different processes for approval. Automation couldn't exist in a vacuum. It needed to be integrated with these existing processes and tools. </li>
            <li> Existing automation solutions didn't provide enough proper feedback to give users peace of mind. Automation felt like a double-edged sword to some users.  </li>
            <li> Manual optimization was a best practice. It could take up anywhere from 5-10 hours / week of our users' time.  </li>
            <li> If users did not optimize their environment, they run the risk of creating more performance issues in the future.  </li>
            </ul>

                <h2> THE SOLUTION</h2>
                <h3> Our solution is Automation Central.  </h4>
                <p> 
                This was a system that allowed users to create "jobs," which are tasks that our tool executes on their behalf. They could simply create a one-time job, recurring jobs, at whatever scale they wanted.

                <p> Our research found that users felt automation was a double edged sword. Without the right amount of precise control and customization, users could automate actions that caused problems. </p>

                <p> 
                For our users, who used to spend at least 3 days learning how to automate operations with scripts in an error-prone process, we reduced this large undertaking into a 5 minute task, with more intuitive controls.
                Our sales teams could now also easily pitch our product because they could easily show reports of product impact. Overall, we increased the business relevance of our product to different teams. </p>

                <h3> Next Steps </h4>
                <p> 
                As we build trust in our system, users will grow more receptive to more automation. We will be creating recommended best practice starter packs that came with preset jobs instead of having users create each automated job individually. Being able to automate specific tasks is just the first step. The next part of the vision is to create entire automated systems for users to enable.
