                What were the chances of us meeting the good friends in our lives? <br> <br> 
                By chance, I happened to run into with one of my good friends at a cafe when we were still strangers. 
                Then we decided to get dinner somewhere, which then set off a chain of events that grew into our friendship today. But what if she decided to go to the cafe just 15 minutes earlier than me?

                In a way, these first chance meetings feel like moments in a big New York City intersection. Everyone's there at the same time by coicidence. Yet, in moments where it is so easy to pass each other by, some people get tied together, and those that hold on become friends. 
                        <br> <br> I know it's cheesy, but it doesn't make me any less thankful.                     </p>
