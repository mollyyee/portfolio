                    As VMware Design grew in maturity, there was a lot of work that we needed to do to build up our team. Through microsites, interactive conference installations, and external info sessions, I led a variety of initiatives that helped share our team’s story.         </p>

                    Our team site was initially sparse, and I felt it was important for us to communicate our story, so I talked to various members of the team to put together how the team wanted to represent itself, and translated that into a microsite.

                    SF Design Week was also a great way to engage with the design community. I led the creation of this design installation with 6 other designers. We simulated enterprise design challenges on the installation and got to share our team’s story.

                    <h3> RADIO Innovation Conference Installation </h4>
                    <p> 
                            VMware has an internal annual innovation conference. At the time, we had roughly a team of 140 designers in a company of 25,000+. Many engineers didn’t have exposure to the value of design. I created an interactive activity with 2 other designers to share the value of design coworkers across the company.                     </p>

                        <h3> RADIO Microsite Design </h4>
                        <p> 
                        After seeing our installation, the RADIO organizers reached out to our team to get input on the RADIO site. It had not been allocated design resources before this. As RADIO was highly visible and also important to our company’s culture, I redesigned the microsite.                         </p>

                                    The projects above may seem like a random hodge podge of initiatives. But they all touch on things that matter to me. <br> <br>

                                    In work settings, I feel it’s important for me to bring in what I personally care about, and then get things done about it. I know the design field could be more inclusive, and other designers felt the same, so we put together a resource to push for this. I also think being a part of community is critical, so I shared my team’s story with the design community through conferences and microsites.
