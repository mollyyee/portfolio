            <h3> With no API standard, building delightful cross-product experiences at scale are near impossible.  </h3>
            <p> As VMware transitions to SaaS, user experience is becoming critical to our business. In order to build cross-product experiences, internal teams need to be able to call each other’s APIs. However, a lack of API standards, consistent documentation and analytics for our wide set of APIs that made this extremely difficult.

                <h2> MY CONTRIBUTION</h2>
                <p> I wrote E2E scripts, created storyboards, re-worked broken workflows,  prototyped an analytics platform, and defined a visual brand for our solution. I relied on the insights our UX researcher found and my engineer’s domain knowledge of my engineers. All of this combined led to the solutions you see below.

            <h2> THE SOLUTION</h2>
            <h3> First, we needed to create visibility around the state of our APIs.  </h4>
            <p> We built analytics and scoring for all the APIs. Without proper analytics, it was impossible for us to understand how teams were doing, where we needed improvements, and which APIs were most important to customers. </p>

            <p> I designed a leaderboard to display scoring for API quality across our 100 products. We didn’t have any official “authority” to improve API quality. A leaderboard was a soft influence approach to quickly provide value and visibility to executives who did have that authority. </p>

                As a small team of seven in a company of 30,000, we relied on soft influence to improve API quality. A leaderboard was a fun way to reward well-crafted APIs.  Top quality teams received medals for holding the best scores!

                    <p> 
                    On top of fixing existing APIs to improve quality, engineer architects conducted reviews to prevent low quality APIs from being shipped. Some of these architects were responsible for dozens of microservices. It was difficult to manage quality. I designed the change logs that helped architects quickly find “problem APIs.”

                When teams saw the analytics, they created Jira tickets with our data to begin logging issues to improve their API quality. Our strategy was working! Teams were getting the visibility they needed into their API health and taking action to fix issues.

                <p> 
                We want to continue adding more useful data to our analytics platform. We want to include Google Analytics information and telemetry data to give product teams a sense of usage. This way we can add a layer of criticality on top of our data and begin prioritizing APIs by how frequently customers use them.
